<p>
  We're people who work in the tech industry in Victoria, Canada.  We organize periodic whisky tasting events that seat 30 people.  In each tasting a mix of newcomers and regulars get a chance to sample some fine whisky, learn a little bit about it, and socialize.  We're also a <a href="https://whiskydev.slack.com/messages/general/">Slack</a> channel where people hang out everyday.

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-size: +2">{</span> Who Can Come? <span style="text-size: +2">}</span></h3>
<p>
  Anyone in tech who wants to have nerdy conversations and drink whisky!  If you can sit in a chair and drink liquid then you're adequately prepared.  Whisky is a good social lubricant and it's easy to make friends in the relaxed atmosphere.
