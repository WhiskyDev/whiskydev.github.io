<h3><span class="brace">{</span> Who Is Whisky Oriented Development? <span class="brace">}</span></h3>
<p>
  We're people who work in the tech industry in Victoria, Canada.  We organize periodic whisky tasting events that seat 30 people.  In each tasting a mix of newcomers and regulars get a chance to sample some fine whisky, learn a little bit about it, and socialize.  We're also a <a href="https://whiskydev.slack.com/messages/general/">Slack</a> channel (<a href="http://slack-invite.whiskydev.com/">new member signup</a>) where people hang out everyday.
  <br/><br/>
  The organizers are Graham Baradoy, Jeffery Grajkowski, Hez Ronningen and Jamie Starke.

<h3><span class="brace">{</span> Who Can Come? <span class="brace">}</span></h3>
<p>
  Anyone in tech who wants to have nerdy conversations and drink whisky!  If you can sit in a chair and drink liquid then we can teach you the rest.  Whisky is a good social lubricant and it's easy to make friends in the relaxed atmosphere.
