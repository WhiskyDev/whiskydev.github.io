Do you like Whisky? Do you like meeting new people? Do you like learning something new?
</p>
<p>
At our events, we hope that you will be able to walk away knowing a bit more about whisky, 
what you like, what you donâ€™t, and maybe even pick up on a favourite new distillery.

Whisky Oriented Development is more than just whisky, it is about connecting with other 
technical people and sharing your passions.  We want it to be a comfortable place where 
you meet other programmers from around town, learn what else is being worked on in 
Victoria, and pick up on some cool new technologies.
