## Tomatin
<img  src="/images/2014-06/IMG_4578.jpg" style="height: 250px"/>

Half way between Inverness and Aviemore in the Scotish highlands. Deep in the Monadhliath Mountains. A formal distillery was first commissioned on the site in 1897, and at 315 metres above sea level, one of the highest in the country. Re-established in 1985 as the Tomatin Distillery company. In 2007, they produced 2.5 million litres. Monadhliath spring water used in distilling. Traditionally this whisky was used to provide fillings for major blended whiskies in Scotland, but more recently, Tomatin is focusing on the company's own brand, and has won several international awards.

## Glenmorangie
