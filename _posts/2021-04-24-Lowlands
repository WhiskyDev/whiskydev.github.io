  desc: Whisky Tasting - Lowlands at last
---

Saturday, April 24, 2021 tasting:
Lowlands Region Whiskies 

Tickets on sale Thursday, April 8, 2021 at 09:00 through [whiskydev.tickit.ca][1].
Choose your pickup/delivery preference in addition to your ticket!

Whisky Dev has a mission to teach you a bit about scotch in every tasting. In 2014, we kicked off a series on the official scotch regions and introduced The Highlands; in 2015, we covered both Islay and Speyside, and Speyside once again in 2017. In 2018, we covered Campbeltown. Finally, on April 24th, 2021 we will complete this long-running series, sampling whiskies from The Lowlands.

Get In!
- Tickets on sale Thursday, April 8, 2021 at 09:00 through [whiskydev.tickit.ca].

**Details**

Online event. Zoom link and further details to follow in an email closer to the event.

1. Get your whiskies: It is preferred that you arrange pick-up from us (Vic West near Tyee/Esquimalt Roads, or Esquimalt near the Red Barn) after April 14th; some deliveries are available. Choose one of the pickup/delivery items at checkout in addition to your ticket. We'll be in touch afterward to confirm times/locations, or please contact us to discuss options!  

2. Beforehand: 
a) Prepare your own glassware. Though we'll be delivering whiskies in small bottles you can drink from if you like, whisky tastings usually use Glencairn or ISO wine tasting glasses for a reason! These feature a bulbous body shape which allows aromas to collect and direct through a narrow rim. Separate glasses are recommended for each whisky -- or at least do a quick rinse+dry between whiskies!
b) Plan a good meal beforehand. Not too spicy or garlicky, to leave your palate ready for the fine flavours.  Similar snacks like sourdough bread, oat crackers, or mild cheese can pair well.

3.  Be there: 6:30 PM Zoom will become available for chat and testing. Provide your own welcome dram (usually a little bit of light beer or whisky, to prime your palate).  At 7:00 PM we'll welcome everyone in the Zoom and get started with the presentation and conversation.
