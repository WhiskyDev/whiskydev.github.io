## Writers Tears Irish Whiskey
### Distillery
* Irish whiskey made in a traditional copper pot still from a mix of malted and unmalted grains.
* On the face of it, "pure pot still" means no more than "distilled entirely in copper pot stills". By convention, however, it also signifies an Irish whiskey made to a traditional recipe that includes unmalted grain.
* These days pure pot still is made entirely from malted and unmalted barley but until recent decades unmalted wheat, oats and rye formed a small part of the mix too.
* This recipe is distinctly Irish. Scottish distilleries, for example, use only malted barley in their pot stills.

### Bottle
* Age: 10yr
* Cask: Bourbon Cask
* Alcohol: 40%
* Tasting Notes
    Aroma
    Wonderfully light and unassuming, fresh grapefruit juice and bright lime zest are most apparent, with that classic light Irish whiskey nose of pencil eraser present in the background.

    Taste
    Sweet and smooth, this is is a humble whisky which presents itself slowly, quietly, and softly. Vanilla and honey intermingle pleasantly with a slight mint overtone. Well balanced, the fresh and sweet notes combine together to create something greater than the sum of its parts. As the whiskey works its way to the back of the tongue, an unexpected essence of under-ripe bananas appears.

    Finish
    Exceedingly long, the finish is written with notes of honey, with a fruity cough lozenge sensation cooling the tongue after several seconds.

## Nikka 12 Year
### Distillery
* Named for Masataka Taketsuru who founded Japan's whisky industry. In 1919 he took summer classes in organic chemistry at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. He also worked at a number of Scottish distilleries. In 1920, he married a Scottish woman despite opposition from both their families. In 1934 he founded his own distilling company, in Yoichi. He believed that this part of Japan was the most similar to Scotland.
* Nikka Taketsuru is a pure malt blend, or a whiskey which is made by vatting together multiple single malt whiskys from different distilleries.  Typically, “blended whiskey,” means a single malt which has been mixed with non-pure spirits or water, which is why the term typically connotes an inferior product or cheap whiskey.  Nikka Taketsuru is a mix of single malts from the two distilleries.

## Amrut Fusion
### Distillery
* Amrut was founded in 1947 following liberalization of the liquor laws, the same year India achieved independence.
* Aged around 4 years before being sold.  That's more than the Kavalan but still remarkable.

### Bottle
* Cask: Oak Barrel
* Alcohol: 50%
* Tasting Notes
    Aroma
    Heavy, thickly oaked and complex: some curious barley-sugar notes here shrouded in soft smoke. Big, but seductively gentle, too

    Taste
    The delivery, though controlled at first, is massive! Then more like con-fusion as that smoke on the nose turns into warming, full blown peat, but it far from gets its own way as a vague sherry trifle note (curious, seeing how there are no sherry butts involved) - the custard presumably is oaky vanilla - hammers home that barley - fruitiness to make for a bit of a free-for-all; but for extra food measure the flavours develop into a really intense chocolate fudge middle which absolutely resonates through the palate

    Finish
    A slight struggle here as the mouthfeel gets a bit puffy here with the dry peat and oak; enough molassed sweetness to see the malt through to a satisfying end, though. Above all the spices, rather than lying down and accepting their fate, rise up and usher this extraordinary whisky to its exit

    Colour
    Golden Yellow
