Do you have a sense of curiosity and a thirst for understanding? Join us at our next 
tasting on **February 21st @ 7pm** as we go for a stroll along the river Spey, take a glimpse 
at the scenery and explore why the Speyside region has the majority of the distilleries 
in Scotland.

If you have attended any of our previous tastings, you know itâ€™s a good time. 

Tickets go on sale this **Tuesday, January 23rd at 8am**, and will be available through 
our [Tickets page][1].
