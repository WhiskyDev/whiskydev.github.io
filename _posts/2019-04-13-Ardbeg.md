We'll see you on **April 13, 2019** for our Ardbeg Distillery Vertical. These whiskies will be heavily peated and a fistful of smote and dirt.

Tickets to go **on sale Thursday, February 28 at 8AM** at [whiskydev.com/tickets][1]. Set your reminders and/or watch [Slack][4], [Facebook][5], or [Twitter][6].

Otherwise, as with all our events:

- There are a limited number of tickets, so grab your tickets, quick!
- Welcome drams are poured from 6:30-7:00.
- The main tasting goes from 7:00-10:00.
- Heels from previous events are poured from 10:00 until midnight.
- Our goal is to offer you the opportunity to learn more about whisky and pick up on new favourites and flavours while connecting with other technical people and sharing your passions. We want it to be a comfortable place where you meet other programmers, learn what else is being worked on in Victoria, and pick up on some cool new technologies.
- You must be of legal drinking age. You may be required to show 2 pieces of ID. We can not serve you if you are intoxicated.
- No refunds.
