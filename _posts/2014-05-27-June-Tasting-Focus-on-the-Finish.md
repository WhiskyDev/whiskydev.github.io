Do you have a thirst for learning new things? Do you like finding out what’s going on around you? Do enjoy the taste of a wee dram?

If you attended either of our last tastings, you know it’s a good time. 

This event, we’re going to focus on the end of the whisky process: the finish. We’ll taste a number of different whiskies, learn about what makes each one different, and have a blast chatting away.

Join us for our next tasting on **June 21st @ 7pm**.

Tickets go on sale **this Friday at 7am**, and will be available through our **[Tickets page][1]**.
