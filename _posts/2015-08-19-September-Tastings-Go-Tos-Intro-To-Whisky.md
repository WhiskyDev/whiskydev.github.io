**[Get your tickets now][1]**

Do you have a sense of curiosity and a thirst for understanding? Join us at our next two tastings this 
September.

On September 18th, back by popular demand, we’ll be running our Intro to Whisky tasting. This event is 
for anyone that did not have a chance to attend our previous Introduction to whisky, or regulars that want to
bring a developer friend to introduce to whisky. This event will feature 8 half ounce pours composed of 
several whiskies from around Scotland, and a Canadian whisky for comparison.

On September 19th, we will be having our “Go To” tasting, where the organizer will share eight bottles that you would find in their own cabinets. As such, you’ll get to experience 8 half ounce pours of deliciousness.

If you have attended any of our previous tastings, you know these will both be a good time. 

Tickets go on sale this Thursday, August 20th at 8am, and will be available through our [Tickets][1] page. Tickets sell out, so be sure to get them early.
