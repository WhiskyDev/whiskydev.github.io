  desc: Whisky Tasting - Finishes
---

We'll see you on **April 18, 2020** for our next **Finishes** tasting a slightly different than normal event. In advance you will receive your 5 whiskies. You will need to setup your own glassware as you desire and we will be presenting the content to you via a Zoom meeting but we will otherwise try to duplicate a 'normal' WhiskyDev event.
This WhiskyDev tasting will focus on finishes - how aging whisky in an additional cask before bottling affects the base whisky.
