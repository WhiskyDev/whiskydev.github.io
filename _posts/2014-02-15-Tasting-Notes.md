* Alcohol: 43%
* Cask: Oak casks, double-matured in dark Moscatel caskwood

    Nose
    Subdued, citric fruitiness; a whiff of bath oil and dentist's mouthwash. A fresh and appetising nose, with little or no trace of smoke. A little water raises almond oil and old-fashioned oilskins; still a fresh fruitiness (lychees?), a trace of olive oil, and after a while pot pourri or scented hand-soap.

    Body
    Firm, smooth, light to medium.

    Palate
    Drinks well at natural strength; sweet start; pleasant, light fragrant smokiness and a lengthy finish. Smooth, pleasant mouth-feel; with water light acidity, some salt and still the sweeter notes. A complex balance of primary tastes.

    Finish
    Sweet smokiness in the lingering, slightly sour finish.
