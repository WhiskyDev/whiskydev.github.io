Do you have a sense of curiosity and a thirst for understanding? Join us for our All Islay
tasting on **Saturday, March 28 @ 7pm**. We will be taking a tasting tour around the 
island known for its smoky and peated whisky. 

If you have attended any of our previous tastings, you know itâ€™s a good time. 

Tickets go on sale this **Thursday, February 26th at 8am**, and will be available through
