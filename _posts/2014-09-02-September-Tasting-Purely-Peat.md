**This event has passed. See the announcement for our [most recent event](/most-recent/)**

Summer is quickly drawing to a close. No doubt you’ve experienced quite a bit since our last tasting. You’ve spent time with friends, debated ideas, had new experiences, and possibly bonded around a fire.

There’s something interesting about fire, and its ability to generate discussion and community, be it a campfire or maybe a barbeque. If you think of one of those times, what senses come to mind? What do you taste? What do you smell?

This event, we’re going to focus on that succulent smoky flavour: peat. We’ll taste a number of different whiskies, learn about what makes each one different, and have a blast chatting away.

If you attended any of our previous tastings, you know it’s a good time. 

Join us on **September 27th @ 7pm**.

Tickets go on sale **this Thursday at 8am**, and will be available through our **[Tickets page][1]**.
