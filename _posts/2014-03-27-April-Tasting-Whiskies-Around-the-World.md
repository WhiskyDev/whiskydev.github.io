By now, you've likely tried Scotch and possibly Rye, but have you tried an Irish, Welsh or Taiwanese whisky?

At Whisky Oriented Development, it's our hope that people walk away knowing a little more about whisky, 
like that there is more to whisky than Scotch. That's why at our next event, on **April 26th** at **7 pm**, we 
will be highlighting the true diversity of whisky, by featuring **8 half ounce drams** from a variety of 
countries around the world.

There will be 30 tickets available for the event, and they will be $40, $35 for early bird tickets, or 
$30 if you're one of the first 10.

If you'd like to get your hands on a ticket, they will go on sale on **Friday April 4th**, at **7:30 am** and 
they will be available through our **[Tickets page](/tickets/)**.
