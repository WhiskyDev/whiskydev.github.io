    desc: Whisky Tasting - Independent Bottlers
---

We'll see you on **January 26, 2019 starting at 7PM** for our Independent Bottlers whisky tasting. This is a new one: independent bottlers offer a new take on existing brands and seek out the best anywhere. Come and see what WE found.

Tickets to go on sale Wednesday, November 7th at 8AM.  The link shall follow shortly before that, via [email newsletter][3], [Slack][4], [Facebook][5], [Twitter][6], and at [whiskydev.com/tickets][1].

- Welcome drams are poured from 6:30-7:00.

- Heels from previous events are poured from 10:00 until midnight.
- Our goal is to offer you the opportunity to learn more about whisky and pick up on new favourites and flavours while connecting with other technical people and sharing your passions. We want it to be a comfortable place where you meet other programmers, learn what else is being worked on in Victoria, and pick up on some cool new technologies.
