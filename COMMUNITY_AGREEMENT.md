# Code of Conduct

## Intro

Whisky Oriented Development is dedicated to providing a safe environment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of members in any form. Members violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community or events (without a refund) at the discretion of the organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion.
- Sexual images in public spaces
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following 
- Harassing photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Inappropriate physical contact
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour 

## Alcohol

Whisky Oriented Development requires that all participants drink responsibly. This means not showing up to events intoxicated, not over consuming at events, and never driving after consuming alcohol.

## Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, organisers retain the right to take any actions to keep the community a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the community or events. 

Organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.

Organizers reserve the right to refuse liquor to any participant.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too! 

## Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it to an organizer as soon as possible. Organizers identify themselves at events and are listed on the [website](https://whiskydev.com/) and can be reached through Slack or email.  Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our events for everyone. We want you to be happy at our events. People like you make our events a better place.
