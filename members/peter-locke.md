Whisky lover, audiophile, marksman, outdoor enthusiast, athlete, dad, engineer, lover of

Not a founding member of Whiskydev but I hold Graham's hand through lineup choices :P


## Technologies of choice

There are many great rapid development languages and frameworks these days.  

The important part, in my opinion, is not the choice of which technology (of course the 
'right tool for the right job' still applies) but rather the application of it.

Success needs more than good technology; it needs a competent team to use it properly to 
achieve the business goal in an efficient, maintainable manner.  

I'm currently a fan of the Grails stack running on AWS, and leveraging all of the tools 
AWS has to offer (caching, queuing, monitoring, auto-scaling, content delivery, hosted 
datastores).

## Professional Interests
